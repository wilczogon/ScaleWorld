Hopefully, one day it will be game available for everyone. For now it is little toy project, which wait for better time. If you went as far as you can see this page - please enjoy this simple piece of code.<br/>
<br/>
Why title "Scale World"? I have no idea. That was first thing about I thought when I had to create project on Github. If you have any better name, send it via email to me.<br/>
About what is this game? About catching monsters - but I want to give them personality and souls, something more than just another collecting game.<br/>

For testing purposes there are created two accounts: Kokeshi/test and Kazik2/test, or you can create your own account (check "register" option).
